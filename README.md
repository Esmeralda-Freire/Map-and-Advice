# React Native App with Geolocation + Map + Advice
Develop a mobile application using React Native that allows users to obtain location-based information, display interactive maps, and receive a random advice.

## Geolocation
The app will access the device’s location to provide relevant information based on the user’s position.
Users can view their current location on the map.

## Interactive Maps
The app will integrate the react-native-maps library to display interactive maps.
Users can navigate the map, view points of interest, and get details about specific locations.

## Random Advice
The app uses the Advice Slip API and randomly selects a piece of advice when the user presses the button.
